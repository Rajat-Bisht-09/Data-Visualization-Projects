## Bank Loan Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data using a combination of **MS SQL** for data extraction and **Power BI** for creating interactive visualizations. The goal is to explore loan application patterns, identify key factors affecting loan approvals, and provide meaningful insights that can aid decision-making processes for banks and financial institutions.

### Project Highlights:
- **Data Extraction with MS SQL:** The raw loan data was extracted, filtered, and transformed using complex SQL queries to ensure efficient and accurate data processing.
- **Power BI Visualizations:** An array of interactive and insightful dashboards were built in Power BI, enabling users to explore loan data, customer demographics, loan status distributions, and approval patterns.
- **Key Insights:** Visualizations include loan approval rates by gender, income levels, loan amounts, and credit history. These insights help in understanding customer profiles and loan risk factors.
- **Decision Support:** The project provides actionable insights for improving loan approval strategies and identifying risk patterns in loan applications.

### How to Use:
- The **SQL scripts** used for data extraction are available in the repository.
- The **Power BI file (.pbix)** can be downloaded to explore the dashboards and insights.
