# Data-Visualization-Projects
Welcome to my Visualization Projects repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing my work in data visualization using Tableau and Power BI. Here, you'll find a variety of projects that highlight my ability to transform raw data into compelling visual stories.

The project focuses on transforming raw datasets into actionable insights through dynamic reports and dashboards. The visualizations aim to provide clear, interactive, and insightful representations of data, allowing users to explore key metrics, trends, and patterns efficiently.

## Key Features:
- **Data Import & Transformation:** Raw datasets were cleaned and preprocessed using Power Query for accurate analysis.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** The project includes user-friendly, interactive dashboards that allow filtering and drilling down into specific data points.
- **Visualizations:** Bar charts, line graphs, maps, and other custom visuals were created to highlight trends, comparisons, and data distributions.
- **Data Insights:** The visualizations help uncover key insights, such as performance trends, growth opportunities, and anomalies.
## Usage:
To explore the analysis, download the Power BI file `(.pbix)` or Tableau file `(.twbx)` from the repository and open it using Power BI Desktop or Tableau Public Desktop.
