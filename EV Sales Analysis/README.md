# Problem Statement

AtliQ Motors is an automotive giant from the USA specializing in electric vehicles (EV). In the last 5 years, their market share rose to 25% in electric and hybrid vehicles segment in North America. As a part of their expansion plans, they wanted to launch their bestselling models in India where their market share is less than 2%. Bruce Haryali, the chief of AtliQ Motors India wanted to do a detailed market study of existing EV/Hybrid market in India before proceeding further. Bruce gave this task to the data analytics team of AtliQ motors and Peter Pandey is the data analyst working in this team.

## Data Preprocessing

### Tools Used:
* MS-Excel
* Tableau
* Canva

### Data 
* dim_date.csv
* electric_vehicle_sales_by_makers.csv
* electric_vehicle_sales_by_state.csv
### Data Description
#### dim_date.csv 
- date: The specific date for which the data is relevant. Format: DD-MMM-YY. (Data is recorded on a monthly basis)
- fiscal_year: The fiscal year to which the date belongs. This is useful for financial and business analysis.
- quarter: The fiscal quarter to which the date belongs. Fiscal quarters are typically divided as Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.

#### electric_vehicle_sales_by_makers.csv

- date: The date on which the sales data was recorded. Format: DD-MMM-YY. (Data is recorded on a monthly basis)
- vehicle_category: The category of the vehicle, specifying whether it is a 2-Wheeler or a 4-Wheeler.
- maker: The name of the manufacturer or brand of the electric vehicle.
- electric_vehicles_sold: The number of electric vehicles sold by the specified maker in the given category on the given date.
#### electric_vehicle_sales_by_state.csv

- date: The date on which the data was recorded. Format: DD-MMM-YY. (Data is recorded on a monthly basis)
- state: The name of the state where the sales data is recorded. This indicates the geographical location within India.
- vehicle_category: The category of the vehicle, specifying whether it is a 2-Wheeler or a 4-Wheeler.
- electric_vehicles_sold: The number of electric vehicles sold in the specified state and category on the given date.
- total_vehicles_sold: The total number of vehicles (including both electric and non-electric) sold in the specified state and category on the given date.
### Data Cleaning
- MS Excel, Power Query to clean and transform raw data.
- Removed duplicate data.
- TRIM() to clean unwanted spaces in cells.
- State DND -> Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Andaman & Nicobar Islands -> Andaman & Nicobar
## Data Visualization
Tableau is used for creating dashboards, calculated fields, parameters and analysis of the data.
### Key Points:
* Fiscal Year: The fiscal year is a one-year period used for financial reporting and budgeting, starting on April 1st and ending on March 31st of the following year in India.

* Penetration Rate: This metric represents the percentage of total vehicles that are electric within a specific region or category. It is calculated as:

		Penetration Rate =  (Electric Vehicles Sold / Total Vehicles Sold) * 100  
   This indicates the adoption level of electric vehicles.

* Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): CAGR measures the mean annual growth rate over a specified period longer than one year. It is calculated as:
        
        CAGR = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value) ** 1/n] -1
### Calculated Fields & Parameters:
#### Calculated Fields-

- Date Part = DATEADD('month',9,DATE(TRIM(LEFT([Date],9))))
